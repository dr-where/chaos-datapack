# chaos-datapack
A chaotic datapack for Minecraft 1.21.5. Adds an explosive desert biome with custom structures, significantly alters entity behavior, and more.

# Installation
Download the chaos_datapack folder. You may end up with a folder called "chaos-datapack" with the "chaos_datapack" folder inside it. If that's the case, remove the inner folder from the outer one. The one with an underscore is the datapack itself. You can verify that you have the correct folder if it has a "data" folder and "pack.mcmeta" inside it.

To use the datapack, you need to add it to the world _before_ generating it.
1. Right-click the chaos_datapack folder in File Explorer (Windows) or Finder (Mac) and click "Copy" or press CTRL-C or CMD-C
2. In Minecraft, go to Singleplayer
3. Click "Create New World"
4. Click the "More" tab in the top-right
5. Click "Datapacks"
6. Click "Open Pack Folder"
7. Paste the chaos_datapack folder into the empty pack folder (Should be named "mcworld-###############")
8. Return to Minecraft. The datapack should be in the "Available" list on the left. Click the right arrow to move it into "Selected"
9. Press "Done"
10. Change any other world settings you'd like, then press "Create New World"
11. If all has gone well, it should warn you that these features are experimental. This is a good thing! Click "Yes"
12. Enjoy the datapack!
